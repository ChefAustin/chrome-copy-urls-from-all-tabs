Chrome Copy URLs From All Tabs
==============================

A Google Chrome browser extension that allows you to create a text file backup of URLs in all open tabs in all windows.

Includes a page where you can view the URL output from the extension. Also supports direct file download.

Currently 3 file formats are available: text, YAML, and HTML.

Preferences can be customised via the Options page. The browser action button that appears in the toolbar can be configured to either open a new tab containing the backup text, or download the text as a file.

The name of the downloaded file is presently not configurable.
